# Country Directory

Welcome to the Country Directory project! This application provides an interactive platform to explore and manage a list of countries. The app allows users to search for countries, apply filters (by region and subregion), and view detailed information about each country.

## Features

- **Country Search**: Search countries by their common name.
- **Filters**: Filter countries by region and subregion.
- **Paginated Table**: View the list of countries with pagination.
- **Country Details**: View detailed information about a country in a modal window.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is responsive and works well across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - Vue.js 3
  - Bootstrap 5 for styling
  - Vue Router (for future routing features)
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - @hennge/vue3-pagination for pagination
  - Bootstrap Modal for displaying country details

- **Backend (In Progress)**:
  - A RESTful API that provides data about countries (e.g., names, regions, subregions). This API is currently being developed, and the frontend is prepared to work with it.

## UI/UX

The UI for the Country Directory project is currently a work in progress. The basic structure is set up, but additional design refinements and features are still being implemented. Feel free to contribute ideas or enhancements!
